# VBA_Stock-Analysis
Refactor VBA code and measure performance (w/ timed variable outcomes displayed)

### Overview of Project
- Steve is in hopes to find what is the rate of return for specific stocks on a year to year basis for his parents. For this analysis we have already accrued data from the years of 2017 and 2018.

### Results
- In the year of 2017, The stocks Steve chose for his parents, as shown in the image below, had a good rate of return. All the stocks, besides TERP (-5.4%), provided a solid return, with DQ providing more than 199.4% year to year return.

- In the year of 2018 however, the stock market took a turn for the negative. Most of the stocks Steve chose for his parents were in the red(negative/not good), with DQ falling by more then 62.6%. However, RUN and ENPH still provided a solid rate of return of 84%, and 81.9% respectively. Parents still we down substantially RUN / ENPH may have had the ability to even them out IF, there funds were manipulated over that period of time.

### Summary
- To summarize, refactoring makes the code more efficient, and allows for a better understanding to read since this would usually be a polish of the original code. It also usually allows the computer to use less memory, and populate some fast results. A disavantage is that by restructuring our code we might create some new errors/problems that we did not have before.
- For example, the biggest advantage of us restructing the VBA script; was at which speed the result were given.

- We can clearly see that the refactored code will give us a much quicker result. Although, one disavantage of us refactoring VBA script was that it did create multiple bugs that had to be addressed while creating the code.
